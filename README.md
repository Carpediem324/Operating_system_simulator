# Operating System Simulator

## os_process_simulator
**by Shin Hyeonhak**

This code was produced in 2022 as a team project for the Operating Systems class at Korea University of Technology and Education.

It is written in Python and utilizes modules such as `numpy` and `pyQt5`.

### Features

- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - RR (Round Robin)
  - SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next)
  - HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)
  - YOSA (Your Own Scheduling Algorithm)

- Supports multi-processor (multiple CPUs) environments.

### How to Run

To verify the program's behavior, run the `show.py` file.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` module
- `pyQt5` module

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carpediem324/Operating_system_simulator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd OSteamproject
3. Install the required modules:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pyqt5
### Usage
Run the show.py file to start the simulator:

 ```bash
python show.py
```
OR

### You can use the ```show.exe``` file in 'dist' directory
